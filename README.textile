h2. RoleSystem

The RoleSystem grants or denies access to controllers methods based on membership to role
groups. The group model has a context attribute, which when set to 'role'
will appear in the member's list or roles

This implementation derives some inspiration from Tim Charper's Role Requirement System

Include this in your ApplicationController to make the RoleSystem available for all controllers.

h2. Example

Here is a hypothetical example of how a model can be created to have roles.

<pre>
  <code>
    @group = Group.create_with(:name => 'admin', :description => 'admin role', :context => 'role')
    @member.groups << @group
    @member.roles => [:admin]
  </code>
</pre>

   Used to find the current user (if any)
   This before filter needs to be called BEFORE any role checking.
   A good place for this would be the application.rb file.

<pre>
  <code>
  before_filter { |controller| controller.role_player = :current_user }

  grant_access_to "editor" # editors are allowed 
  grant_access_to "admin", :only => :destroy # Editors can create but not destroy 
  </code>
</pre>

h2. Valid Options

* :only - Only require the role for a specific actions
* :except - The role is required for all but the specificed action(s)
* :if - A Proc or string to evaluate; a result of true means the role is required.
* :unless - The opposite of if

h2. Example Account Model Methods

The Role System expects that the account model includes a has_role? method, which is used 
to determine available roles.

<pre>
  <code>
    def roles
      groups.find(:all, :conditions => "context = 'role'")
    end
    
    def has_role?(role)
      roles.map{ |g| g.name.downcase.to_sym }.include?(role)
    end
  </code>
</pre>

This plugin was originally developed for the excellent website Newstrust, which graciously 
gave me permission to make it open source.
